## GIT commands

### Set remote repository URL  
```console

```

### Change remote repository URL  
```console
 git remote set-url origin http://git-server/repository.git
```

### Checkout remote branch as local
If -B is given, <new_branch> is created if it doesnâ€™t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of
Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branc were called and then checked out. 
```console
 git  checkout -b release/202109-rel-ocp4 origin/release/202109-rel-ocp4
```
### Checkout and push branch to remote under different name
git push  <REMOTENAME> <LOCALBRANCHNAME>:<REMOTEBRANCHNAME> 
```console
  git push origin refs/heads/release/xy:feature/ab
```

### Create local branch from current branch and push remotely
```console
  git checkout -b release/r1
  git push -u origin release/r1
```
 ### Create local branch from remote
```console
  git checkout -b develop origin/develop
```
 
### Rebase -- add all commits from branch to the current branch 
 -f -history was change - force required
 -i -interactive
 --rebase-merges
 -u -set-upstream
```console
  rebase -i --rebase-merges  develop
  git push -u origin release/r1 -f
```

 ### Rewrite last commit
```console
  git add *
  git commit --amend -m "last commit comment"
  git push -u origin feature/2 -f
