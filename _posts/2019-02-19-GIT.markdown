## GIT commands

### Set remote repository URL  
```console
 git remote add origin http://git-server/repository.git
```

### Change remote repository URL  
```console
 git remote set-url origin http://git-server/repository.git
```

### Checkout remote branch as local
If -B is given, <new_branch> is created if it doesnâ€™t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional equivalent of
Specifying -b causes a new branch to be created as if git-branc were called and then checked out. 
```console
 git  checkout -b release/202109-rel-ocp4 origin/release/202109-rel-ocp4
```
### Checkout push branch to remote under different name
git push  <REMOTENAME> <LOCALBRANCHNAME>:<REMOTEBRANCHNAME> 
```console
  git push origin refs/heads/release/xy:feature/ab
```
