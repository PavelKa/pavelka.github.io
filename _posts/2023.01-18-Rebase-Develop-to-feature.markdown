## How to rebase the develop branch onto the feature branch using force-with-lease, you can follow these steps:

First, make sure that you are on the develop branch by running the following command:

```console Copy code
git checkout develop
```
Next, update your local repository by fetching the latest changes from the remote repository:

``` Copy code
git fetch
```
Then, switch to the feature branch:
```Copy code
git checkout feature
```
Before rebasing, ensure that you have a clean working directory by committing or stashing any changes:

``` Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Committing changes before rebase"
```
Now, you can rebase develop onto feature using force-with-lease:

``` Copy code
git rebase --force-with-lease develop
```
This will apply the changes from the develop branch onto the feature branch, rewriting the commit history of the feature branch to include the changes from develop.

Finally, push the changes to the remote repository:

```Copy code
git push --force-with-lease origin feature
```
Note that force-with-lease is a safer alternative to --force as it will only overwrite changes if the remote branch is at the expected commit. It protects against overwriting changes from another developer who has pushed changes to the remote branch since you last fetched updates.
